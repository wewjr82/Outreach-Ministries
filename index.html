      <div class="circle-parent"><img src="images/IMG_5050.jpg"></div>
      <p>
        Prophetess Jenai is the daughter of Deacon David C. Jackson and
        Deaconess Norma J. Jackson and proud sister to her late Brother, Kamren
        M. Jackson. At the young age of 9 years old Prophetess Jenai Jackson
        received the Lord as her personal Savior. One night at a very young age,
        Evangelist Willie Riddick prophesied that Jenai would one day be a
        prophetess and preach the Gospel. Prophetess Jenai taught her first
        Bible lesson at the age of 16 at Holy Temple United Holy Church of
        America, Incorporated. At the age of 22 she preached her first sermon
        entitled, “Are You Connected to the Source.” She also went on to teach
        Sunday School, Vacation Bible School, Bible Study, and Children’s
        Church.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prophetess Jenai is a native of Suffolk, Virginia where she graduated
        with honors from Nansemond River High School. After graduating high
        school, she went on to further her education at Saint Augustine’s
        University, a historically black college in Raleigh, North Carolina. In
        2010, she started her first prayer group on campus with a close friend,
        Lady Shamyrah Davis. In 2012, Prophetess Jenai obeyed the voice of the
        Lord telling her to move back home to Virginia. She transferred to Old
        Dominion University where she later received her Bachelors of Science
        degree in Biology PreMed with a minor in Religion.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2016, Prophetess Jenai went on to become a Professional Personal Care
        Assistant, Medication Aide Technician, and a Phlebotomist. In 2017,
        Prophetess Jenai attended the Sentara College of Allied Health to
        receive her certificate as a Nursing Care Partner. In 2018, she began
        working as a Nursing Care Partner for Sentara Norfolk General Hospital.
        She later became a Certified Nursing Assistant and a Registered
        Medication Aide for the State of Virginia in 2019. Prophetess Jenai has
        won many awards while serving in the Level 1 Trauma Center at Sentara
        Norfolk General Hospital. In 2024 she began working as a Community
        Health Worker for Sentara Norfolk General Hospital. Prophetess Jenai
        uses every moment as a ministry moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        By way of the Holy Spirit, Prophetess Jenai birthed her ministry,
        Destined for Greatness, Design with a Purpose Outreach Ministries in
        2017. The mission of Destined for Greatness is to teach others how to
        pray, have mountain moving faith, show unconditional love, and spread
        God’s Holy Word through evangelism. Prophetess Jenai launched another
        ministry in 2020 during the global pandemic. God allowed Jenai, along
        with her family, to have a series of Friday Night Hour of Power
        Services. The Lord showed up and showed out by moving in a mighty way.
        The Jackson Family was able to be a blessing to others. In February
        2022, Prophetess Jenai decided to further her education by attending
        Walden University where she will pick back up studying for her Masters
        in Clinical Mental Health Counseling in the near future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prophetess Jenai was elevated on September 17, 2022 to an ordained Elder
        and installed Pastor over her ministry Destined for Greatness, Designed
        with a Purpose Outreach Ministries by the Chief Apostle Mario L. Davis
        of Victory Christian International Fellowship of Churches, Incorporated.
        Pastor Jenai was appointed on September 15, 2024 as the first Supervisor
        of Women for the newest jurisdiction “Tidewater Ecclesiastical
        Jurisdiction” of Victory Christian International Fellowship of Churches,
        Incorporated by the Chief Apostle Mario L. Davis and the Presiding
        Prelate of the Tidewater Jurisdiction, Bishop Natasha Johnson. Pastor
        Jenai has served as the Youth Pastor for Freedom Worship Center,
        Incorporated. Pastor Jenai’s number one goal is to serve the Lord with
        gladness and build God’s kingdom so that lives can be changed.
